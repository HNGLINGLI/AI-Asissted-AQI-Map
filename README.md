# AI Assisted AQI Map

## Description
This project is a dynamic map of Taiwan that showcases prominent landmarks through interactive pins. Each pin offers detailed information about the location, including descriptions and a convenient link to Google Maps for easy navigation. The map features an AQI (Air Quality Index) layer, providing users with environmental data at a glance. Additionally, the project incorporates a collapsible chat interface powered by the Gemini API, allowing users to engage effortlessly by submitting queries through speech-to-text technology or by typing. This feature enhances the user experience by supporting both Chinese and English languages in text and speech input, making it accessible to a broader audience.

## Features
- **Interactive Map**: A detailed map of Taiwan with pins representing various prominent locations.
- **Foldable Pins**: Each pin opens a foldable pop-up section containing:
  - A picture of the location.
  - A description of the destination.
  - A link to view the location on Google Maps.
- **Legend**: A legend to categorize the types of destinations (e.g., cultural & historical sites, natural wonders, and leisure & entertaiment).
- **Chat Feature**: A foldable chat interface that utilizes the Gemini API, allowing for natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to recognize typos and improve user input.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Integrates a Speech Recognition API to convert spoken queries into text for user input.
- **Language Recognition**: Automatically sorts queries in English and Chinese, enhancing user interaction and comprehension.
- **AQI Map Layer**: The map includes a switchable AQI (Air Quality Index) layer with a meter indicating the AQI level. Users can zoom in and out using the controls at the top left of the map or by using their mouse.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling the map and chatbox user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and functionality.
- **Python**: Used in Google Colab for developing and creating the map functionality.
- **Google Maps API**: To embed maps and provide location details.
- **Gemini API**: For generating responses in the chat feature.
- **Speech Recognition API**: For converting speech to text in the chat interface.
- **OpenWeather Map API**: For fetching weather data and displaying it to users.
- **Translation API**: For translating user input and responses in the chat interface.
- **Visual Studio Code**:  For editing and managing the project files.
