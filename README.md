The AI-Assisted AQI Map is an innovative platform that blends environmental awareness with user engagement through cutting-edge technology. By integrating Generative AI and real-time data, this web-based application enables interactive exploration of Taiwan‚Äôs landmarks, provides access to Air Quality Index (AQI) and weather data, and features bilingual AI-powered chat functionality for seamless interaction in English and Traditional Chinese. This project aims to raise public awareness of air quality, aiding informed health decisions and supporting future environmental and public health improvements.

## Features

### üåç Interactive Map
- **Landmark Pins**: Explore destinations with images, descriptions, and direct Google Maps links.
- **Foldable Pins**: Each pin opens a foldable pop-up section containing:
  - A picture of the location.
  - A description of the destination.
  - A link to view the location on Google Maps.
- **Categorized Legend**: Quickly identify cultural, natural, and recreational landmarks.

The interactive map application is designed to integrate real-time pollution data and AI-driven user interactions. The architecture is divided into several key modules, each responsible for specific functionalities:

1. **User Interface**:
   - **Map Interface**: Provides an interactive map allowing users to explore different locations.
   - **Foldable Chat Box**: Enables users to interact with the system through a collapsible chat interface.

2. **Map Module**:
   - **Python-based Interactive Map**: The core functionality of the map, developed using Python.
   - **Toggleable Landmark Markers**: Allows users to toggle markers representing various landmarks on the map.
   - **Pollution Data Display**: Displays real-time pollution data directly on the map.
  
3. **Data Module**:
   - **Pollution Data Repository**: A database storing pollution data.
   - **Real-time Data Fetching & Updating**: Continuously fetches and updates real-time data to keep the map current.

4. **Backend Processing**:
   - **Data Integration & Processing**: Integrates and processes data from various sources.
   - **Database Communication**: Communicates with the database via an API to retrieve and store data.
  
5. **AI Module**:
   - **Gemini AI Chat System**: Provides AI-driven chat functionality for user interaction.
   - **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Converts spoken queries into text for processing.
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Text Input**: Processes text input from users for intelligent responses.
